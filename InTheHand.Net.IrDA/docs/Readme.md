# InTheHand.Net.IrDA

InTheHand.Net.IrDA supports client and server IrDA connectivity for Windows. The Object model is based on Microsoft's IrDA implementation for Windows CE / .NET Compact Framework which was ported to desktop Windows in the original release of 32feet.NET. It will be very familiar if you have used TcpClient/TcpListener classes in .NET.

## Supported Platforms

This library, although released as a .NET Standard dll, is only compatible with Windows (Everything from Windows XP through to Windows 11 as long as you have a compatible IrDA dongle and driver).
